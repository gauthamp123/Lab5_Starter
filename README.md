1. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

Yes it would be beneficial to unit test because in the context of the application we can isolate the individual feature and test if it can handle all input and if the other user recieves the message.

2. Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

Yes it would be a good sanity check by sending in a string longer than 80 characters and seeing what happens.
